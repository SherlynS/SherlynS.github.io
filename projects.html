        <h3>Below is some of my best work ü©µ</h3>
        <p>
            This project was created at the start of my carrer at Amherst as a computer science student.
            <br>
            <br>
            The main focus of this project was to make a fun user expireince and throwback to the old mario mini games.
            <br>
            <br>
            Growing up i loved playing Super Mario Bros, and within the game were mini games that i absolutely enjoyed play day and night. 
            Overall this project is inspired by one of the mini games called : Catch the criminal with the theme of Mario.
            I am planning on making it a full game soon and so far this is where my game lives.
